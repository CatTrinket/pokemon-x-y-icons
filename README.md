This is pretty messy, I know.  I need something for the pair programming part
of the [Hacker School][] interview process, and I figured sprucing this up
might work, so I've uploaded it in its current state so I can propose it.

Requires pypng.  Also, lzss3.py is taken from [magical's nlzss
repository][nlzss].
